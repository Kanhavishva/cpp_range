# C++ Range

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whoshuu/cpp_range.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whoshuu/cpp_range)

Have your cake and eat it too. Who says you can't have nice things in an efficient, type-safe, compiled language? Don't let your Python-slinging coworkers have the last laugh, this is C++ Range:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "range.h"

using namespace whoshuu;

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    for (auto i : range(100)) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 0 to 99
    }

    for (auto i : range(10, 100)) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 10 to 99
    }

    for (auto i : range(10, 0, -1) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 10 to 1, counting down
    }

    for (auto i : range(2.718, 100.0, 3.14) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl; // Prints 2.178 to 96.918, by increments of Ï€, yum!
    }
}
```

## Benchmarks

Here's an initial benchmark using Clang 3.6.0 of my library against a [naive vector range implementation](https://gist.github.com/whoshuu/246b10cdd7341895453f) and [basic for-loop](https://gist.github.com/whoshuu/6eea496a891ef03a5b9e):

![C++ Range Benchmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whoshuu/cpp_range/master/benchmark/benchmark.png)

As you can see, for ranges up to `100000`, all approaches are roughly equivalent. In most applications, this is perfectly acceptable, and the tradeoff in performance for an idiomatic (not to mention flexible) range iterator is probably worth it. The most optimal loop will always be the basic for-loop however, so if efficiency is paramount, use that instead.

You can find raw data for the analysis [here](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpp_range/blob/master/benchmark/benchmark.csv).

## Install

Just throw the header into your project, be wary of the `whoshuu` namespace, and let it rip!

## Requirements

The only explicit requirement is a C++11 compatible compiler such as clang or gcc. The minimum required version of gcc is unknown, so if anyone has trouble using library with a specific version of gcc, do let me know.
